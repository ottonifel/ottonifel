### About me

IÂ´m studio ghibli lover. I love listening to music, watching animes and hanging out with friends.<br> I'm currently studying computer science at UFScar in Sorocaba-SP. There, I was a marketing member of the junior web development company, where I carried out web application projects and where, later, I became director of the marketing area, picking up during those years not only hard skills, but also soft skills. <br> I also worked as a database student mentor, where I improved my knowledge of the subject and found the area I liked best in computer science.
